Given more time I would get the actual link to the URL from the JSON and load that gif image.  This is just a quick project, to show the outline.

Simplify and make JSON quick to implement by formatting data for viewing and then making model automatically…

Project purpose — To show gif image loaded from web to our users.

Successful login redirects to a
"details" screen…
with "username"
"logout" button
"gif title"
A "random GIPHY*" gif
"author name" received in api response.

——  Wants…

Content centered vertically and horizontally
Some basic input validation
Any username is accepted
Valid password is "password"
Valid password should transition to a welcome screen with a logout option, a trending gif image from api response, it's title and an author
Loading spinner should be shown while gif request is executed
Logout brings the user back to login screen

The contents should be centered properly regardless of screen orientation
transition between screens should be a "replace", not pop-over
UI is not that important, please pay more attention to the code and app's architecture and functionality
upload your solution to a repository on github
